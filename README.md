# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

This repository contains code for a Kaggle competition project aimed at predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for taxi rides in New York City, using Machine Learning techniques.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used for this project contains pickup and dropoff locations in New York City. You can obtain the dataset from the Kaggle competition page:

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Download the dataset from the competition page and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks to run the code for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

3. Train your machine learning models and save them in the `models/` directory.

4. Make predictions on new data by modifying the code in the notebooks or creating separate scripts in the `src/` directory.
